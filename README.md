<p align="center">
  <em>Visualizing Earth's climate journey through time‚Äîpast, present, and possible futures.</em>
</p>

## üåç About

Earth Unfolded provides an interactive 3D visualization of our planet across different time periods, from prehistoric times to projected future scenarios. This educational tool makes climate change tangible and visually striking, helping users understand Earth's climate journey through an immersive experience.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Timeline**: Navigate through seven distinct climate eras
- **3D Earth Visualization**: Observe how Earth's appearance changes across different periods with dynamic atmospheric effects
- **Climate Data Dashboard**: Explore temperature and CO‚ÇÇ levels with intuitive charts 
- **Era-Specific Information**: Learn about climate impacts and solutions for each time period
- **How Can You Help**: Discover actions aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals to combat climate change
- **Responsive Design**: Experience the application on any device

## üìö Project Background

### Inspiration

Traditional climate data can often feel abstract and disconnected from our daily lives. We wanted to create an interactive experience that allows users to literally see how our planet has changed over time. The UN Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG 13 (Climate Action), were a significant motivator for this project.

### Challenges

Building Earth Unfolded presented several technical challenges:

- **Performance optimization** for 3D rendering
- Creating intuitive **data visualizations** for complex climate information
- Designing smooth **transitions between time periods**
- Ensuring **mobile responsiveness** for a 3D-heavy application
- Balancing **visual appeal with scientific accuracy**

## üå± What's Next for Earth Unfolded

We plan to expand the project with:

- Enhanced data visualization with more detailed climate metrics
- AR/VR integration for even more immersive climate exploration
- Personalized carbon footprint calculator
- Educational curriculum resources for teachers and students
- API integration with real-time climate data sources
- Multi-language support
